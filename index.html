          Never sleep until you share what you've worked today with the world(I mean, with your friends).

          Watched "Moneyball(movie)". After watching it, I read an article "Can an NBA team adapt moneyball strategy?". Somebody was arguing that basketball is more of a "team sport", thus
          it only works to some extent. But if you're saying it's harder to adapt moneyball in other sports, that's where one sees opportunty in technology, right?

          Recently I've been watching a lot of Bloodbourne playthrough videos on YouTube(EpicNameBro is my favorite). From that, I've been collecting information about the game director, Miyazaki Hidetaka.
          He joined the developer company rather late, nearly at his 30. Then in 5 years, he joined "Demon Soul", which was sold about 2 million copies worldwide.

          trying to 'insert' something in between something. do you think it's a good idea to take their values, and divide the difference by 2 and supply that as its sort_order val?

          When learning, it is efficient to write down key sentences and come back later, try to answer them by recalling the subject.
